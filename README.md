# Final-Project
Undergraduate Thesis

This final project focuses on imbalanced data classification in the Drug Consumption (Quantified) dataset
using threshold optimization, combined with ensemble learning methods such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. Based on the results of the research, threshold optimization generally improves classification performance, especially in the minority class, by improving evaluation metrics such as recall, F-measure, and G-mean, although it lowers evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and specificity.
